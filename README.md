### hi<br>
okay so just 
1. setup your webserver software to be pointed at public/
2. setup a mysql/mariadb instance
3. you're gonna need to recreate the SQL, which I will not provide a schema file for.
4. go in models/db.php.example and change the credentials in there to the ones you have
5. rename models/db.php.example to models/db.php
