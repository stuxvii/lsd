The Button will make a selected GridMap to be visible
<br>
and collide-able when any PhysicsBody3D enters its trigger area (Activated).
<br>
<br>
To assign it a GridMap, set the Map property in the Inspector
<br>
to a GridMap present in the current scene.
<br>
<br>
The button will be considered Activated if a PhysicsBody3D enters its trigger area,
<br>
and it will be considered Deactivated if a PhysicsBody3D exits its trigger area, regardless
<br>
of if one was already present.
<br>
<br>
Tip: You can assign multiple buttons to a singular GridMap.
