The Machine Gun is a dangerous object. It will shoot bullets 
that deal 1 damage to the player if the player touches the bullet.
<br>
<br>
The Machine Gun has no PHitbox or LHitbox.
<br>
<br>
The Machine Gun has an assignable option for "Target". This can be any Node3D such as the Ball or the Player.

<br>
Its settings are:
<br>
<br>

* Rate: How many seconds to wait to shoot the next bullet

* Spin Speed: How many radians per second will the gun spin

* Follow Target: This setting when enabled will make it so the machine
gun follows the Target constantly, regardless of distance.

* Range: This goes together with Follow Target. This is the activation range for the Machine Gun.
<br>
If Follow Target is disabled, the range will be infinite, and the machine gun will just shoot regardless.
